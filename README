Ok... the intention of this code, in so far as one could call this code, is only to find out whether ajessup on github is the man I know.  Now, one would speculate that the easiest way to find this out would be simply to ask said man. But no sir.  The internet more than chatting on facebook and lolcatz, it's made for time wasting pointless code.
